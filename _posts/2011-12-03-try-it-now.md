# Prerequisites

* Node.js - Here's the official
  [documentation](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation).
* Redis - Redis is an advanced key/value store. It's where Apiaxle
  stores its data. Find [the installation
  instructions](http://redis.io/download) on redis.io.
* NPM - NPM is the Node package manager that Apiaxle uses to... manage its
  packages. Here are the [installation
  instructions](http://npmjs.org/).

# Apiaxle

If you're willing to, run this:

    $ mkdir components && cd components
    $ curl https://raw.github.com/philjackson/apiaxle/master/bin/setup-apiaxle.bash | bash

It will checkout the three components of Apiaxle into the current
directory and all of their dependencies (by running `npm
install`).

## Trying it with the Facebook Api

Lets say you want to put the Facebook graph API behind a proxy. Here's
how you might do it:

    $ cd apiaxle

Start the proxy service with this command:

    $ ./apiaxle_proxy.coffee 3000

It'll now listen on port `3000`.

## Apiaxle.base

This is a code repository that is shared by the other two Apiaxle
components. There's nothing to run but there is a configuration file
which you might need to modify.

## Apiaxle

This is the main proxy component.
