# Prerequisites

* *Node.js* - Here's the official
  [documentation](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation).
* *Redis* - Redis is an advanced key/value store. It's where Apiaxle
  stores its data. Find [the installation
  instructions](http://redis.io/download) on redis.io.
* *NPM* - NPM is the Node package manager that Apiaxle uses to... manage its
  packages. Here are the [installation
  instructions](http://npmjs.org/).

# Apiaxle

If you're willing to, run this:

    $ mkdir components && cd components
    $ curl https://raw.github.com/philjackson/apiaxle/master/bin/setup-apiaxle.bash | bash

It will checkout the three components of Apiaxle into the current
directory and all of their dependencies (by running `npm
install`).

## Trying it with the Facebook Api

Lets say you want to put the Facebook graph API behind a proxy. Here's
how you might do it:

    $ cd apiaxle

Start the proxy service with this command:

    $ ./apiaxle_proxy.coffee 3000

It'll now listen on port `3000`. If you now hit http://localhost:3000/
you'll get an `ApiUnknown` error message. That's because Apiaxle
decides which API you want to use via subdomains. Try putting this
line in your `/etc/hosts` file:

    127.0.0.1 facebook.api.localhost

Now when you hit http://facebook.api.localhost:3000/ you'll see the
same error but with a slightly different message. That's because
Apiaxle doesn't know *how* to call facebook. There are some helper
scripts which lets us define APIs and keys. First create the api:

    $ ./bin/new-api.coffee --end-point=graph.facebook.com facebook

Now create an API key:

    $ ./bin/new-key.coffee --for-api=facebook 1234

Now try calling the graph API with any of the options you know it
accepts. Here's an example that will print our my information:

    $ curl 'http://facebook.api.localhost:3000/yet.more.information?api_key=1234'

Try it without the key and you'll get an error. If you try to hit the
API more that twice a second you'll get a Qps error.

Under the hood this has been translated to
`graph.facebook.com/yet.more.information`.
